# Portfolio Website

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio repository. This portfolio was built with React, Vite and TailwindCSS. The main focus (and challenge) was implementing responsive design for all different screen sizes. I went for a pastel colour theme website with an option for both light and dark mode colours. 

The website includes:

- Home Screen
- About Me
- Skills
- Projects
- Contact

You can use the navigation bar along the top to scroll to any of these screens easily. It also features a back-to-top button on the contact page that takes you to the home screen.

I hope you enjoy it and please let me know if there are any improvements!

## Instructions

Run the following commands to display the code on your own device:

Install the necessary dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```console
npm run dev
```

Install Tailwind CSS:

```console
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Initialize Tailwind CSS:

```console
npx tailwind init -p
```
