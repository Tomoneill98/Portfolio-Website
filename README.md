# Portfolio Website

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio repository. This portfolio was built with React, Vite and TailwindCSS. The main focus (and challenge) was implementing responsive design for all different screen sizes. I went for a pastel colour theme website with both light and dark mode colours. I hope you enjoy it and please let me know if there are any improvements!

## Instructions

Run the following commands to display the code on your own device:

Install the necessary dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```console
npm run dev
```

Install Tailwind CSS:

```console
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Initialize Tailwind CSS:
