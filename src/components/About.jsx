Additionally, I learnt how to work with other industry-leading practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming and Version Control. Developing with both frontend and backend tech stacks has enabled me to create robust and efficient applications.</p>

Fast forward six months, I've advanced from grasping coding fundamentals to crafting a responsive portfolio website and participating in a team effort to develop a mobile application. I'm excited to see what I will in the coming months, as I intend to apply my new skills to deliver exceptional user experiences and make a positive impact through programming.</p>
