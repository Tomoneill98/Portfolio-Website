Fast forward six months, I've advanced from grasping coding fundamentals to crafting a responsive portfolio website and collaborating with a team to develop a mobile application. I'm excited to see what I will do in the coming months, as I intend to apply my problem solving skills to deliver exceptional user experiences and make a positive impact through programming.</p>

Additionally, I worked with other industry-leading practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming and Version Control. Developing with both front end and back end tech stacks has enabled me to create robust and efficient applications.</p>
                    <p className="mb-6  bg-offWhite rounded-lg p-3 md:pr-10 dark:bg-teal-700 font-mono">// Beyond coding, I enjoy spending time with my feline friends, practising Spanish, going on hikes in the beautiful Peak District and listening to Taylor Swift! </p>
